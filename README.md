# PortaPack-SD-cards


 These PortaPack SD card files are for UK frequencies: I have modified the standard SD card  file so that it covers items like:
 * **UK pagers**  
 * **UK GSM,3G,4G,5G frequency alocation**
 * **UK CB channels** 
 * **UK Amature band plan**
 * **RadioSone" using UK frequencies**
 * **PMR446 Change to UK frequencies**
 * **UK DABPlus**
 * **Added Time Signal frequencies**
 * **Other relevent changes in line with the OFTEL Spectrum allocation.** 
 * **Added DeBruijn file. So a shorter brute force attack on OOK can be used.**

The  File will be updated when the new features for Scanner are added in the next release, as theis gives more flexability on the settings.
